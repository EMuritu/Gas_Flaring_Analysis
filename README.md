# Gas_Flaring_Analysis
## 1. Introduction
Gas flaring is the controlled burning of natural gas that is released during the extraction of oil and gas. This typically occurs at oil production sites where infrastructure to capture and transport the gas is unavailable, uneconomical or undeveloped. When crude oil is brought to the surface, it often comes mixed with natural gas. If the gas cannot be stored or used, it is burned (flared) to dispose of it safely. While it may be necessary for safety and operational reasons, it also represents a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and energy waste. Globally, billions of cubic meters of natural gas are flared every year, contributing significantly to climate change and air pollution.

The World Bank’s Global Gas Flaring Reduction (GGFR) Partnership provides publicly available, satellite-based estimates of gas flaring by country and oil production site. This dataset offers a valuable opportunity to examine global trends, identify high-flaring regions and assess the effectiveness of reduction initiatives.

This project leverages the World Bank’s gas flaring dataset to explore historical trends, geographic patterns and correlations with oil production and policy interventions.

## 2. Problem Statement
According to a report published by the International Energy Agency(2024), around 139 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas was flared globally—equivalent to the entire annual gas consumption of sub-Saharan Africa, resulting in approximately 500 million tonnes of CO₂-equivalent emissions.Despite growing awareness and international commitments to reduce emissions, gas flaring levels remain persistently high in several countries. There is a critical need for transparent, data-driven analysis to:

* Quantify the scale and impact of global gas flaring
* Top flaring countries and regions over time
* Analyze trends in relation to oil production and policy milestones
* Support accountability and inform targeted mitigation strategies.

This project aims to bridge the gap between raw satellite data and actionable insights through visualization and exploratory data analysis. The ultimate goal is to highlight opportunities for sustainable energy practices and contribute to ongoing global reduction efforts
